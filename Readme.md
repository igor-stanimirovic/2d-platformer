# Jump Man - 2D Platformer Game

## Overview

Welcome to Jump Man, a 2D platformer game that showcases my skills in 2D game development using Unity. This game is based on a course I watched for guidance since I haven't created many 2D Platformers, but I've heavily modified it.
I'm still learning Unity 2D & 3D Development. This is just a part of my journey hope you enjoy it.
